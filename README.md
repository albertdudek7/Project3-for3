# Project 3-for-3

## Requirements

For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
  - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
  - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
  - A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.

## Technical Requirements for Project 3

### Data and Delivery (25 points)

- The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. (5 points)
- A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). (5 points)
- The project is powered by a Python Flask API and includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the chosen database. (10 points)

### Back End (25 points)
- The page created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. (7.5 points)
- A JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. (7.5 points)
- The project conforms to one of the following designs: (10 points)
- A Leaflet or Plotly chart built from data gathered through web scraping
- A dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data

### Visualizations (25 points)
- A minimum of three unique views present the data. (5 points)
- Multiple user-driven interactions (such as dropdowns, filters, or a zoom feature) are included on the final page. (5 points)
- The final page displays visualizations in a clear, digestible manner. (5 points)
- The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels. (10 points)

### Group Presentation (25 points)
- All group members speak during the presentation. (5 points)
- The content is relevant to the project. (5 points)
- The presentation maintains audience interest. (5 points)
- Content, transitions, and conclusions flow smoothly within any time restrictions. (10 points)

## Project Guidelines
The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, your project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.

### Collaborating with Your Team
Remember that these projects are a group effort. The experience of close collaboration will create better project outcomes and help you in your future careers. Specifically, you’ll learn collaborative workflows that will enable you to approach and solve complex problems. Working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage!

### Project Proposal
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This will help provide direction and safeguard against scope creep (the tendency for projects to become more complex after work begins).

The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:
- The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)
- The questions you’ll ask of the data
- Possible source for the data

Use the following example for guidance:

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We’ll examine relationships >between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over >the course of a year, and other related relationships derived from the data.

## Data Cleanup and Analysis
Now that you’ve picked your data, it’s time to tackle development and analysis. This is where the fun starts!

The analysis process can be broken into two broad phases: (1) exploration and cleanup, and (2) analysis.

As you’ve learned, you’ll need to explore, clean, and reformat your data before you can begin answering your research questions. We recommend keeping track of these exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter notebook to keep you organized and make it easier to present your work later.

After you’ve cleaned your data and are ready to start crunching numbers, you should track your work in a Jupyter notebook dedicated specifically to analysis. We recommend focusing your analysis on multiple techniques, such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time-series analysis. Don’t forget to include plots during both the exploration and analysis phases. Creating plots along the way can reveal insights and interesting trends in the data that you might not notice if you wait until you’re preparing for your presentation.
